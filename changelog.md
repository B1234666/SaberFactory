*(for Beat Saber 1.18.1)*

- [Alpha] [Patreon] Added new modifier tab (edit components, visibility of parts and position/scale of transforms on the saber)
- Added option to automatically reload the saber when the file changes (`ReloadOnSaberUpdate` in config)
- Added option to modify saber length (added by @9cxndy)
- Moved .meta and .trail files to seperate folder (`UserData\Saber Factory\Cache`) to not fill up the CustomSabers folder
- Fixed compatibility issues with mods that bind `PluginMetadata`
- Many internal code changes

__**!!Presets aren't compatible with previous version!!**__  
__**!!Make sure to delete the `Beat Saber\UserData\Saber Factory\Presets\default` file!!**__

*You can safely delete the .trail and .meta files in your CustomSabers folder*

*Needs `BeatSaberMarkupLanguage` and `SiraUtil` (available on ModAssistant)*
